BIO120H1 - Adaptation and Biodiversity,"Principles and concepts of evolution and ecology related to origins of adaptation and biodiversity. Mechanisms and processes driving biological diversification illustrated from various perspectives using empirical and theoretical approaches. Topics include: genetic diversity, natural selection, speciation, physiological, population, and community ecology, maintenance of species diversity, conservation, species extinction, global environmental change, and invasion biology. A lab coat is required and the cost is approximately $16 if students wish to purchase it through the Department. (Lab Materials Fee: $26)",Grade 12 Biology or equivalent. Students without high school Biology must consult the BIO120 Office (bio120@utoronto.ca),,Living Things and Their Environment (4),Science
BIO130H1 - Molecular and Cell Biology,"One of the goals of modern biology is to understand how the basic building blocks of life give rise to biological form and function. This course provides students with a common lexicon to understand the key principles and concepts in molecular and cell biology, with a focus on how the building blocks of life lead to functioning cells. (Lab Materials Fee: $10). Lab coat and safety glasses are required for use in laboratories; students are responsible for purchasing these items (approximate cost is $25).",SBI4U and SCH4U (Grade 12 University Preparation Biology and Chemistry) or permission of department.

BIO220H1 - From Genomes to Ecosystems in a Changing World,"Dynamics of genetic and ecological change in biological systems, from genomes to ecosystems. Evolutionary genetic and ecological perspectives on wide-ranging topics including disease, aging, sexual conflict, genetics of human differences, conservation, and global climate change. Applications of evolutionary, ecological, and molecular-genetic principles and processes. Responsibilities of human societies in a changing world. (Lab Materials Fee: $26).",BIO120H1,,Living Things and Their Environment (4),Science
BIO230H1 - From Genes to Organisms,"The genome is the ""book of life,"" providing instructions to construct an organism. This course introduces genome biology and explores how the building blocks of life are networked into functioning organisms. We will investigate how cells perceive internal and external cues, how gene expression is shaped by this perception, and how these events give rise to tissues, organs, and whole organisms. (Lab Materials Fee: $15). Lab coat and safety glasses are required for use in laboratories; students are responsible for purchasing these items (approximate cost is $25).","BIO130H1, (CHM135H1, CHM136H1)/(CHM138H1, CHM139H1)/CHM151Y1",,Living Things and Their Environment (4),Science
"BIO251H1 - Form, Function and Development in Plants","Introduction to structure, function, and ecology of vegetative and reproductive processes in plants with a focus on flowering plants and gymnosperms. Lectures and labs emphasize photosynthesis, respiration, mineral nutrition, transport processes, patterns of plant growth and development, the role of hormones in development, photomorphogenesis, and plant reproduction. (Lab Materials Fee: $26).",BIO120H1,BIO251Y1,Living Things and Their Environment (4),Science
BIO255H1 - From Genes to Organisms with Advanced Laboratory,"The genome is the ""book of life,"" providing instructions to construct an organism. This course introduces genome biology and explores how the building blocks of life are networked into functioning organisms. We will investigate how cells perceive internal and external cues, how gene expression is shaped by this perception, and how these events give rise to tissues, organs, and whole organisms. The Enhanced Laboratory provides the opportunity for greater laboratory skill development in modern investigative techniques and is intended for students interested in conducting their own laboratory research. (Lab Materials Fee: $50). Lab coat and safety glasses are required for use in laboratories; students are responsible for purchasing these items (approximate cost is $25).","BIO130H1, (CHM135H1, CHM136H1)/(CHM138H1, CHM139H1)/CHM151Y1, cGPA 3.0",,Living Things and Their Environment (4),Science
BIO260H1 - Concepts in Genetics,"This is a problem based course which discusses classical, molecular, developmental, and population genetics and genomics with emphasis on model organisms for genetic analysis.",BIO230H1/BIO255H1,,Living Things and Their Environment (4),Science
BIO270H1 - Animal Physiology I,"Animal physiology is a biological sub-discipline that aims to understand, in physical and chemical terms, how animals work. This course uses examples from throughout the animal kingdom, in a comparative approach, to introduce and study homeostasis and the endocrine system. Accompanying laboratories reinforce concepts introduced in lectures and provide opportunities for students to experience firsthand the role that experimentation, data collection, interpretation of data, and communication of data plays in the nature of the scientific process.
