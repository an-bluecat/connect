MSE458H1 - Nanotechnology in Alternate Energy Systems,"The unique surface properties and the ability to surface engineer nanocrystalline structures renders these materials to be ideal candidates for use in corrosion, catalysis and energy conversion devices. This course deals with the fabrication of materials suitable for use as protective coatings, and their specific exploitation in fields of hydrogen technologies (electrolysis, storage, and fuel cells) linked to renewables. These new devices are poised to have major impacts on power generation utilities, the automotive sector, and society at large. The differences in observed electrochemical behavior between amorphous, nanocrystalline and polycrystalline solid materials will be discussed in terms of their surface structure and surface chemistry.

MSE478H1 - Materials Manufacturing and Design Laboratory II,"This half year design course focuses on the simulation informed design and execution of a product and continues on the concepts learned in MSE398. Working in small groups, students will use the principles of materials selection and computer simulation to design and build a product of their own choosing. This design focused course will guide students through several iterations of their product design, each iteration further informed by computer simulation. Materials selection will include selection for mechanical design, process, and shape and will also be used to inform each iteration of the design process. Finally, computer simulation results will be experimentally validated in parts of, or the entire the final product. This course will involve significant time involved in hands-on manufacturing. The course is accepted as one of the Advanced Electives for the Advanced Manufacturing Minor.",MSE398Y1,,
