PSY194H1 - The Psychology of Student Success,"University life presents students with all sorts of challenges as well as amazing opportunities for learning and growth. While there are many different ways to define a “successful student”, the goal of this seminar is for everyone to develop the knowledge, skills, and mindset needed to make the most of out of the university experience. Students will discover what research in psychological science has to say about facing and overcoming common academic, intrapersonal, and interpersonal challenges, as we cover topics including deliberate practice, imposter syndrome, and belongingness.

PSY195H1 - The Science of Babies,"Up until roughly four decades ago, infants were seen as cute, clueless creatures. Yet, research from a range of fields has led to a radical consideration of this claim; infants may be cute but they are not clueless! In this class, we will consider and discuss the science of babies. In particular, we will take a second look at long-held beliefs about the nature of infants and their knowledge. We will learn that studying infants’ perception, cognition and behaviour can offer us critical insights into long-standing philosophical questions. This course provides an interdisciplinary introduction to infancy, that includes content from psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, as well as biology and anthropology. Upon completion of this class, students will (1) have overview knowledge of aspects of infancy as it relates to perception, cognition and behavior; (2) be able to use exploratory writing to develop arguments and develop their understanding of subject matter; and (3) begin to be able to read and summarize a scientific research paper in Developmental Psychology.

"PSY196H1 - Critical Periods, Brain Plasticity and Development","This course will ask how changes in the developing brain can influence our understanding of how humans learn. To answer this question, we will learn about how the brain changes and about how learning changes. We will dig into brain plasticity and ask how this influences “critical” or “sensitive” periods for learning: a phenomenon whereby learning can only take place during a particular time in an organism’s life. We will explore learning in a number of different ways including learning in sensory and motor systems and the development of multiple aspects of learning and memory. In all cases, we will ask how changes in the developing brain impact learning outcomes. Restricted to first-year students.

PSY197H1 - The Individual and Society,"How does one develop a sense of individuality? Can individual will and freedom be reconciled with the interests of society? Are we determined by society or culture or do we, in some important sense, determine our own behaviour and futures? In this course, we will use classic and contemporary readings from psychology, sociology, anthropology, philosophy, and law to explore general characterizations of the individual and society. Basic questions will be examined in light of these characterizations such as: Is there a universal human nature? Who is a “person”?, and What is the ideal society? We will examine these questions in light of various social issues, such as debates about multiculturalism and democracy, whether children have rights to freedom of speech, and women’s equality in society. Throughout the course, the emphasis will be on the different views of the person underlying and informing contrasting perspectives on important social questions. Restricted to first-year students.
